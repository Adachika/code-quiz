### Link to deployed application

## Description
The goal of this project is to design a timed multiple choice quiz using Javascript. The quiz utilized Javascript arrays and objects to store questions. A time interval function was used to begin a countdown timer. Eventlistener was added to display the multiple choice questions to the user once the start button is clicked. It was also used to check if the user selected the correct answer. If an incorrect answer is selected, the timer subtracts 10 seconds from the allotted time. Once the user has answered all questions or if the timer reaches zero before all questions are attempted, the quiz is over and the final score is displayed to the user. The user is presented with the option to enter their initial to view highscores. Local storage is used to keep track of all previous scores and the scores are in descending order from highest to lowest.
